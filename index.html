<section class="about-me">
    I am a programmer from China, in the United States, 2012 graduated from Dalian University of Technology, major in communications,
    entered Alibaba, 5 years and a half to the wireless business unit, Taodian, Alipay, word of mouth and other departments,
    code throughout App on mobile phone Taobao, Alipay, Taodian, etc., left at the end of 2017, went to the US emperor and
    family reunion, became a "world citizen" I like to brush the Cousera and the major MOOC platforms, tossing various technologies.
    In the words of HR, it is a highly self-motivated person. The memory is medium to low. You must use the words to record
    what you have learned. Good reading, seeking solutions, full of anxiety about knowledge, getting paid subscriptions for
    more than 10, in the words of the lady, "a lot of good things, it is a bad life." Typical Chinese amaranth, chasing up
    and down, perennial investment losses, but never tired of it; believe in trend trading, abandon value investment

<section class="about-me">
    我是一名来自中国，身在美帝的程序员，2012硕士毕业于大连理工大学通信专业，进入阿里巴巴，5年半间辗转于无线事业部，淘点点，支付宝，口碑等部门，代码遍布于手机淘宝，支付宝，淘点点等App，2017年末离职，前往美帝和家人团聚，成为"世界公民"
    喜欢刷Cousera和各大MOOC平台，折腾各种技术，用HR的话说，是一个高度自我驱动的人，记忆力中等偏下，必须用文字记录下所学所感，遂有此博客 好读书，求甚解，对知识充满焦虑，得到付费专栏订阅超过10个，用夫人的话说是"大道理一堆，就是过不好这一生"
    典型的中国韭菜，追涨杀跌，常年投资亏损，却乐此不疲；信奉趋势交易，摒弃价值投资
