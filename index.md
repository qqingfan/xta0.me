I'm a programmer from China, who is now living in the US. I graduated from Dalian University of Technology with a master's
degree in EE. In 2012. I joined Alibaba. In the past 6 years, I have been transferred to the wireless business unit,
Taodian, Alipay, word of mouth and other departments, the code is distributed in mobile phones Taobao, Alipay, Taodian
and other applications. The position before the resignation was a senior technical expert (P8), leading a 15-person
iOS R&D team to develop Alipay's O2O business. Tired of daily life with the goal of reporting PPT, he brought his
wife and children to the US emperor. I started my second half of life with a new identity and role, which made me
very excited.

这是徐韬的个人博客。一名来自中国，身在美帝的程序员，2012硕士毕业于大连理工大学通信专业，进入阿里巴巴工作。过去6年辗转于无线事业部，淘点点，支付宝，口碑等部门，代码遍布于手机淘宝，支付宝，淘点点等App。离职前的职位为高级技术专家(P8)，带领一支15人的iOS研发团队开发支付宝的口碑业务，因厌倦了每日以汇报PPT为目标的的生活，一气之下携妻儿来到美帝，以全新的身份和角色开始了人生的下半场，这让我无比兴奋。
我喜欢刷Cousera，折腾各种技术，是一个高度自我驱动的人，记忆力中等偏下，必须用文字记录下所学所感，遂有此博客。好读书，求甚解，对知识充满焦虑，目前专注于移动端和伪全栈开发，正在学习自动驾驶相关技术，同时对分布式系统和计算投资两个领域有着极大的兴趣。
