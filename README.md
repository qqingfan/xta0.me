## xta0.me

This is my personal website built in Jekyll. Jekyll is a static website generator widely used for building blogs. 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xta0/xta0.me.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xta0/xta0.me)



## Theme

I've been reading [Yihui Xie's](https://yihui.name/) articles for quite a few days, I really enjoy it, he's a greate scientist and also a good writter. I like his website's desgin which is pretty clen and neat. So I reproduced the theme on my own using Sass and Flexbox. However, my version is a little bit compilicated since I added more UI elements, like sidebar, with lots of javascript involved. So far the code has not been abstracted as a framework. If anyone interesed, feel free to open an issue or checkout the code and mess around with it.
