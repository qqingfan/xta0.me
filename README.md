This is my personal website page built in Jekyll. Jekyll is a static website generator widely used for building blogs. It allows you to modify the code without manunly re-compile the whole page which is really handy. But it becomes really slow when your site is getting bigger. To make life easier, I've added some other tools to fix this problem, check out the description below.

### Install

1. Install Jekyll by following their [webpage](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. Install NPM&Gulp
3. Download or clone the repo on your computer. Open your terminal, type:
    1. `npm install` This will download gulp
    2. After install finished, type `gulp watch`, this will trigger the auto sass compile
    3. `jekyll serve`
    4. Open your browser, you are ready to go


### Themes

I've been reading [Yihui Xie]'s articles for quite a few days, I really enjoy it, he's a greate scientist and a good writter. Also I found his website's desgin is really neat. So I reproduced his theme on my own using Sass and Flexbox. However, my version is a little bit compilicated since I added more UI elements, like sidebar, with lots of javascript involved. So far the theme code has not been abstracted as a framework. If anyone interesed, feel free to open an issue or checkout the code and mess around with it.
