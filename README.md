This is my personal blog website page built in Jekyll. Jekyll is a static website generator widely used for building blogs. The built-in command `jekyll serve` let you modify the code without manunly compile the whole page which is really handy. But it becomes really slow when your site is getting bigger. To make life easier, I've added some other tools, check out the description below.

### Install

1. Install Jekyll by following their [webpage](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. Install NPM&Gulp
3. Download or clone the repo on your computer. Open your terminal, type:
    1. `npm install` This will download gulp
    2. After install finished, type `gulp watch`, this will trigger the auto sass compile
    3. `jekyll serve`
    4. Open your browser, you are ready to go
