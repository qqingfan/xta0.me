## Prgramming Paradigms

***Paradigm***: In science, a *paradigm* describes distinct concepts or thought patterns in some scientific discipline.Main programming paradigms:
- imperative programming
- functional programming
- logic programming

Orthogonal to Object-oriented programming

### Imperative Programming

Imperative programming is about:

- modifying mutable varaibles
- using assignments
- and control structure such as if-then-else, loops, break, continue, return.

The most common informal way to understand imperative programs is as instruction sequences for a Von Neumann computer：

```
Processer <---Bus---> Memory
```

There's a strong correspondence between

```
mutable variables <-> memory cells
variable dereferences <-> load instruction
variable assignments <-> store instructions
control structures <-> jumps
```

- *Problem*
	- 扩展性问题
	-  Scaling up. How can we avoid conceptualizing programs word by word ?

- *Reference*
	- John Backus, Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? 
	- Turing Award Lecture 1978. 1950s 发明Fortran，20年后意识到Fortran的局限性。

In the end, pure imperative programming is limited by the "Von Neumann" bottleneck:

> *One tends to concepualize data structures word-by-word.*

We need other techniques for defining high-level abstractions such as collections, polynomials, geometric shapes, strings, documents,...
Ideally: Develop *thories* of collections, shapes, strings...

### What is a Theory?

A theory consists of :

- one or more data types 数据类型
- operations on these types 数据操作
- laws that describe the relationships between values and operations 它们之间的关系

**Normally, a theory does not describe mutations!**

### Theories without Mutation

For instance the theory of polynomials defines the sum of two polynomials by laws such as:

`( a * x +b ) + (c * x +b ) = (a+c)* x + (b+d)`

But it does not define an operator to change a coefficient while keeping the polynomial the same

但是Theory中并没有关于mutation的定义，一个多项式的系数如果用代码表示:

```
class Polynomial { double[] coefficient; }
Ploynomial p = ...;
p.coefficient[0] = 42;
```
p的系数可以从外部被修改而变化，而p却不变，这显然违背了数学公式的唯一性：当系数确定时，多项式p是唯一的，当系数变化时，产生新的多项式p。因此，数学函数是没有mutation的，但是将这个模型映射到程序中，却很难做到。


### Consequences for Programming

If we want to implement high-level concepts following their mathematical theories, there's no place for mutation.

承接上面的问题，如果我们想把数学模型映射到程序中，是不允许mutation存在的。

- The theories do not admit it.

- Mutation can destroy useful laws in the theories

Therefore, let's :

- concentrate on defining theories for operators expressed as functions

- avoid mutations

- have powerful ways to abstract and compose functions.

### Functional Programming

- In a *restricted* sense, FP means programming without mutable variables, assignments, loops, and other imperative control structures.没有变量，赋值，循环，过程性控制语句

- In a *wider* sense, functional programming means focusing on the functions

- In particular, functions can be values that are produced, consumed, and composed.functions in a FP language are first-class citizens.

	- they can be defined anywhere, including inside other functions
	
	- like any other value,they can be passed as parameters to functions and returned as results
	
	- as for other values, there  exists a set of operators to compose functions.

### Some FP lanugages

- In the restriced sense:
	- Pure Lisp, XSLT, XPath, XQuery, FP
	- Haskell(without I/O, Monad, or UnsafePerformIO)
	
- In the wider sense:
	- Lisp, Scheme, Racket, Clojure
	- SML, OCaml, F#
	- Haskell(full language)
	- Scala
	- Smalltalk Ruby(!) 支持block的OOP
	
### History of FP lauguages

- 1959 Lisp
- 1975-77 ML,FP,Scheme
- 1978 Smalltalk
- 1986 SML
- 1990 Haskell, Erlang
- 1999 XSLT
- 2000 OCaml
- 2003 Scala, XQuery
- 2005 F#
- 2007 Clojure

### Recommended Book

- **<SICP>**: A classic. Many parts of the course and quizzes are based on it, but we change the language from Scheme to Scala.

- **<Programming in Scala>**: The standard language introduction and reference

### Why Functional Prgramming?

- simpler reasoning principles
- better modularity
- good for exploiting parallelism for multicore and cloud computing.

	- 多核对并行计算有要求，但是现代的编程语言缺乏对这方面的支持
	- Parallel Programming vs Concurrent Programming
		- 并行编程主要利用CPU多核特性，使任务处理变的快速，但是任务处理可以使有序的
		- 并发编程指的是同一时刻需要处理许多任务
		- Both too hard to get right!
		
	- The Root of The Problem
		- 多线程引起的不确定性
		- 不确定性 = 平行计算 + mutable state
		- 如果要保证并行计算的确定性，首先要avoid mutable state
		- Avoiding mutable state 意味着 programming functionally
	- Scala:
		- Agile, with lightweight syntax
		- OO
		- Functional
		- Safe and performant, with strong static typing
	- Different Tools for Different Purposes
		- Parallelism:
			- Collections : Parallel Collections
			- Collections : Distributed Collections
			- Parallel DSLs
		- Concurrency:
			- Actors
			- Software transactional memory
			- Futures
