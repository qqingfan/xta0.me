### Course Topics
- Vocabulary for design and analysis of algorithms
    - "Big-O" notation
    - "Sweet spot" for high-level reasoning about algorithms
- Divide and conquer algorithm design paradigm
    - Will apply to : Integer multiplication, sorting, matrix multiplication, closet pair.
    - General analysis methods
- Randomization in algorithm design
    - Will apply to : Quick sort, primality testing, graph partitioning, hashing
- Primitives for reasoning about graphs
    - Connectivity information, shortest paths, structure of information and social networks
- Use and implementation of data structures
    - Heaps, balanced binary search trees, hashing and some variants

### Merge Sort: Motivation and Example

- Why Merge Sort
    - Good introduction to divide & conquer
        - Improves over Selection, Insertion, Bubble sorts
    - Calibrate your preparation
    - Motivates guiding principles for algorithm analysis
        - worst - case
        - asymptotic analysis
    - Analysis generalizes to "Master Method"

- Merge Sort Pseudocode

```
C = output [lenght = n]
A = 1st sorted array[n/2]
B = 2nd sorted array[n/2]

```
