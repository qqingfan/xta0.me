## 使用GDB & LLDB

> 使用GDB调试需要有debug symbol，编译时可以通过`-g`生成

### GDB tricks

- `gdb --args [PROGRAM]` Normally, gdb takes arguments you give it and assumes they are for itself. Using --args passes them to the program.

- `thread apply all bt` .Dump a backtrace for all threads. It’s very useful.

- `gdb --batch --ex run --ex bt --ex q --args [PROGRAM] [ARGS]`Run the program so that if it bombs, you get a backtrace.


### GDB参考

- `run [args]` Start your program with `[args]`.
- `break [file:]` function Set a break point at [file:]function. You can also use b.
- `backtrace` Dump a backtrace of the current calling stack. Shorthand is `bt`.
- `print expr` Print the value of expr. Shorthand is `p`.
- `continue` Continue running the program. Shorthand is `c`.
- `next` Next line, but step over function calls. Shorthand is `n`.
- `step` Next line, but step into function calls. Shorthand is `s`.
- `quit` Exit GDB.
- `help` List the types of commands. You can then get help on the class of command as well as
the command.
- `cd`, `pwd`, `make` just like running these commands in your shell.
- `shell` Quickly start a shell so you can do other things.
- `clear` Clear a breakpoint.
- `info break`, `info watch` Show information about breakpoints and watchpoints.
- `attach pid` Attach to a running process so you can debug it.
- `detach` Detach from the process.
- `list` List out the next ten source lines. Add a  to list the previous ten lines.

### LLDB参考

- `run [args]` Start your program with [args].
- `breakpoint set --name [file:]function` Set a break point at [file:]function. You can also
use `b`, which is way easier.
- `thread backtrace` Dump a backtrace of the current calling stack. Shorthand is `bt`.
- `print expr` Print the value of expr. Shorthand is `p`.
- `continue` Continue running the program. Shorthand is `c`.
- `next` Next line, but step over function calls. Shorthand is `n`.
- `step` Next line, but step into function calls. Shorthand is `s`.
- `quit` Exit LLDB.
- `help` List the types of commands. You can then get help on the class of command as well as
the command itself.
- `cd`, `pwd`, `make` just like running these commands in your shell.
- `shell` Quickly start a shell so you can do other things.
